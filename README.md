# Btree-implementation
In this project I implemented a btree from scratch in C++. The program will take in an input file which specifies all 
commands sush as insert or delete along with the value to be inserted or deleted. A log file which keeps track of the process along 
with a dot file for btree display will be generated at the end.

To run the program, simply download the code with the make file and type **run_command.txt**, the command.txt file is
the file in which command are stored. You can modify run_command.txt or import your own input file.
